`ndndn` (NDN Docker Net) is a set of tools and Docker images aimed at easing the process of testing NDN software as close to the “real world” and hardware as possible. 

`ndndn` utilizes [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool - a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. For NDN developers, it allows to quickly deploy a network topology defined graphically in a `.dot` using multiple Docker containers. 

Using `ndndn` to run an experiment is a three-step process. 
* First, one prepares a `.dot` file describing experiment topology and a folder with `Dockerfile` and supporting files for the Docker image of an application being tested. 
* Then, `ndndn generate` is used to generate an experiment folder with `docker-compose.yml` configuration file which describes experiment setup in “Docker compose” terms.
* Finally, `ndndn run` is used to run the experiment.

A `.dot` file describes network topology graph a user wish to run, by defining three types of nodes (**_h_**_ub, _**_p_**_roducer, _**_c_**_onsumer_), links between these nodes and links’ properties (_latency, loss, bandwidth_). Each node of the topology graph will eventually become a Docker container when running experiment. These containers are based off Docker images defined by `Dockerfile`s at the moment of generation. There are no limits on how many containers must be in the topology, though there is a limit (right now) on haw many network-shaped links each node can have (no more than 7). 

> If you are rich in hardware resources or financially, you may be interested in setting up [Docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) in order to run very serious experiments. There was a time, I’ve tried swarming on Amazon EC2 instances, it was lit.

There are two types of nodes defined by `ndndn` - **hub** and **app**. 
_TBD describe node types_

## build ( ´◔ ω◔`) ノシ
* macOS

```
brew install multitail
cd ndndn
virtualenv env && source env/bin/activate
pip install pypandoc
pip install .
```

* ubuntu
```
apt-get install -y pipenv multitail
pipenv install
```

## use  ƪ(ړײ)‎ƪ​​
* prepare app folder with `Dockerfile`  and supporting files for your application Docker image
	* see more [here]() on what  to consider when creating an app image
	* it is implied that your app can work in consumer/producer mode OR that you provide two executables in your app Docker image
* generate experiment

```
ndndn generate --topology=topology.dot --hub=`pwd`/hub --app=`pwd`/app --consumer-env=`pwd`/app/consumer.env --producer-env=`pwd`/app/producer.env
```

	* this command will generate a folder with the following:
		* `docker-compose.yml` — Docker Compose yml file describing your setup
		* `topology.pdf`
		* `hub` — symlink to the `hub` folder
		* `app` — symlink to the `app` folder
* run experiment
	* change to the newly generated folder and type:
```
ndndn run
```

> `ndndn run` is just a wrapper around `docker-compose up -d —build` command.  
> It has not been tested against different versions of docker-compose vs docker, so if you get any errors, please report an issue or contact author.
